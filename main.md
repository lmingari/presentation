# Introduction and motivation

- Atmospheric dispersion models can provide realistic distributions of airborne volcanic ash and gases or tephra deposits
- Traditionally, operational forecast systems rely on volcanic ash transport and dispersal (VATD) models to produce deterministic forecasts
- Ensemble modelling poses new challenges: we explore approaches for dealing with large volumes of ensemble data, data interpretation and applications 

__Why ensemble modelling?__

- **Uncertainty in model input parameters:** Deterministic models are highly sensitive to uncertain model input parameters (e.g. eruption source parameters) and meteorological fields. We can take into account these uncertainties using ensemble modelling
- **Quantification of model output uncertainty:** Ensemble-based modelling allows one to characterise and quantify model output uncertainties. In addition to traditional forecasting products, the associated errors can be provided 
- **Improvement of forecast skill:** Real observations can be incorporated into dispersal models using ensemble-based data assimilation techniques
- **Source inversion:** Different techniques for source term inversion have been proposed based on ensemble modelling

# Ensemble simulations: Probability distribution

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="35%"}
The gamma distribution provides a good approximation to the ensemble distribution:

- $\overline{y} < \sigma_y$  $\rightarrow$ mode=0
- $\overline{y} > \sigma_y$  $\rightarrow$ mode>0
- Right-skewed probability distributions

__Run configuration__:

- Test case:  __2015 Etna eruption__
- Ensemble size = 120 members

__Traditional products__:

- Ensemble mean
- Ensemble spread
- Exceedance probability

__Complexity reduction__:

- Remove redundancy in the ensemble data
- We need to measure the distance $d_{ij}$ between two model states $i$ and $j$
- Ensemble members with similar distances are grouped

# Ensemble-based data assimilation {.t}
__GNC method__:

- We propose a heuristic first-order data assimilation method for lower-bounded (positive) variables
- The Gaussian with non-negative constraints (GNC) method assumes a multi-dimensional Gaussian probability distribution and a linear observation operator 
- A non-negative quadratic programming problem is solved using an iterative approach
- This method leads to better results than other DA techniques, including the classical Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)

# Conclusions

* When ensemble simulations are useful?
  - Whenever the ESP or meteorological conditions have large uncertainties
  - If forecast errors must be quantified
  - If observations are available to be assimilated
  - When the emission source needs to be characterised
* How should the ensemble be constructed? Which variables should be perturbed? What's the minimum ensemble size required?
  - We gave a preliminary insight into which parameters are the most sensitive
  - What is the minimum ensemble size corresponding to each case
* How interpret and deal with large volumes of ensemble data? Which probabilistic output products are relevant?
  - We proposed a complexity reduction technique in order to identify qualitatively different states in the ensemble
  - We obtained approximate solutions of the physical model, including the state that is most likely to be sampled, and assigned a probability
  - These physically consistent states can be compared directly with satellite images
* Are the traditional assimilation methods suitable for the atmospheric dispersion of volcanic species?
  - Traditional data assimilation methods lead to suboptimal performance in the case of VATD model
  - We propose a new ensemble-based data assimilation method which outperforms the classical EnKF method when is applied to VATD models
